<h1>Privacy Policy for Focus Reader, PDF, All Offices</h1>

<p><b>CoolCool Studio</b> built <b>Focus Reader, PDF, All Offices</b> as a Free app. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we access on your device, how we use it to provide our document reading services, and how we handle any non-personal information we collect.</p>

<p><b>Last Updated: September 2, 2025</b></p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p><b>Personal and sensitive user data</b> includes, but isn't limited to, personally identifiable information, financial and payment information, authentication information, phonebook, contacts, device location, SMS and call related data, health data, Health Connect data, inventory of other apps on the device, microphone, camera, and other sensitive device or usage data.</p>
<p><b>Non-Personal Information</b> means information that cannot be used to identify a specific individual. For example, the duration of a page visit, the time when you use a service.</p>

<h2>Data Handling</h2>

<p><b>Focus Reader, PDF, All Offices</b> is designed to provide you with a comprehensive document viewing experience by scanning and organizing your documents. To perform its core functions, our app requires access to certain data categories on your device:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Storage/Document Data:</b> To scan, detect, and display PDF, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and text files stored on your device for viewing and management.</li>
	<li><b>File Metadata:</b> To organize documents, enable search functionality, and manage bookmarks for your files.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Important:</b> All processing of this data (including scanning your documents and creating bookmarks) is performed **locally on your device**. <b>Focus Reader does NOT collect, store, or transmit any of your personal or sensitive user data (documents, files, bookmarks, etc.) off your device to our servers or any third parties.</b> Your documents and data remain entirely private to your device.</p>

<p><b>Focus Reader</b> does collect limited non-personal information:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Device Information:</b> Phone's model, version of Android, and other similar general information to help us debug problems if users send email to us, and to understand device compatibility.</li>
	<li><b>App Usage Analytics:</b> We use Firebase Analytics (<a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics">https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics</a>) to understand how users interact with the application (e.g., features used, file types opened, crashes). This data is anonymized and helps us enhance user experience and improve the app.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>

<p>As stated above, <b>Focus Reader, PDF, All Offices</b> does not share your personal or sensitive user data (documents, files, bookmarks) with any third parties.</p>
<p>When you use the Share feature within the app, you are directly sharing files through your device's native sharing functionality. We do not intercept or store this shared data.</p>
<p>Non-personal analytical data (device information, app usage analytics) collected via Firebase Analytics is shared with Google, as per Firebase's privacy policy, to provide us with aggregated, anonymized insights for app improvement.</p>

<h2>Permissions Usage</h2>
<p>To function correctly and provide its intended document reading services, <b>Focus Reader, PDF, All Offices</b> requires the following permissions:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</b>: Allows the app to access and scan files and directories on your device's storage (internal and external) for the purpose of detecting and displaying PDF, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and text files. This is core to the app's functionality.</li>
	<li><b>INTERNET</b>: To facilitate in-app purchases (subscriptions/premium features) and to transmit anonymized non-personal analytics data via Firebase.</li>
</ul>
<p>We only use these permissions for the stated purposes to provide the document viewing and management features of the app.</p>

<h2>Features & Functionality</h2>
<p>Our app provides the following features, all processed locally on your device:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Document Scanning:</b> Automatically scans and indexes PDF, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and text files on your device.</li>

	<li><b>Share:</b> Shares documents using your device's native sharing capabilities.</li>
	<li><b>Delete:</b> Removes unwanted documents from your device storage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>Since all document processing and storage happens locally on your device, the security of your documents depends on your device's security settings. We recommend using device-level security features such as screen locks and encryption to protect your data.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Our app does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>
