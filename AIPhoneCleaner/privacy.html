<h1>Privacy Policy for AI Phone Cleaner</h1>

<p><b>CoolCool Studio</b> built <b>AI Phone Cleaner</b> as a Free app. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we access on your device, how we use it to provide our cleaning services, and how we handle any non-personal information we collect.</p>

<p><b>Last Updated: June 19, 2025</b></p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p><b>Personal and sensitive user data</b> includes, but isn't limited to, personally identifiable information, financial and payment information, authentication information, phonebook, contacts, device location, SMS and call related data, health data, Health Connect data, inventory of other apps on the device, microphone, camera, and other sensitive device or usage data.</p>
<p><b>Non-Personal Information</b> means information that cannot be used to identify a specific individual. For example, the duration of a page visit, the time when you use a service.</p>

<h2>Data Handling</h2>

<p><b>AI Phone Cleaner</b> is designed to enhance your device's performance by identifying and managing files and applications. To perform its core functions, our app requires access to certain sensitive data categories on your device:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Storage/Media Data:</b> To detect large files, duplicate files, similar photos, blurred photos, too dark/bright photos, and screenshots for cleaning.</li>
	<li><b>Installed Apps & Usage Data:</b> To detect app usage and recommend uninstalling unused applications.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Important:</b> All processing of this sensitive user data (including scanning your files and app list) is performed **locally on your device**. <b>AI Phone Cleaner does NOT collect, store, or transmit any of your personal or sensitive user data (files, photos, app list, etc.) off your device to our servers or any third parties.</b> Your data remains entirely private to your device.</p>

<p><b>AI Phone Cleaner</b> does collect limited non-personal information:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Device Information:</b> Phone's model, version of Android, and other similar general information to help us debug problems if users send email to us, and to understand device compatibility.</li>
	<li><b>App Usage Analytics:</b> We use Firebase Analytics (<a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics">https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics</a>) to understand how users interact with the application (e.g., features used, crashes). This data is anonymized and helps us enhance user experience and improve the app.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>

<p>As stated above, <b>AI Phone Cleaner</b> does not share your personal or sensitive user data (files, photos, app list) with any third parties.</p>
<p>Non-personal analytical data (device information, app usage analytics) collected via Firebase Analytics is shared with Google, as per Firebase's privacy policy, to provide us with aggregated, anonymized insights for app improvement.</p>

<h2>Permissions Usage</h2>
<p>To function correctly and provide its intended cleaning services, <b>AI Phone Cleaner</b> requires the following permissions:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</b>: Allows the app to access, scan, and manage files and directories on your device's storage (internal and external) for the purpose of detecting large files, duplicate files, and photos (similar, blurred, etc.) for cleaning. This is core to the app's functionality.</li>
	<li><b>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</b>: Allows the app to see the list of all installed applications on your device. This is necessary to detect app usage and recommend applications for uninstallation.</li>
	<li><b>PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS</b>: Allows the app to access information about app usage history, which helps in identifying unused apps for recommendation.</li>
	<li><b>INTERNET</b>: To facilitate in-app purchases (subscriptions) and to transmit anonymized non-personal analytics data via Firebase.</li>
</ul>
<p>We only use these permissions for the stated purposes to provide the cleaning and optimization features of the app.</p>
